# Credit card management system
Companies like Amex have millions of customers with multiple credit cards. They have to manage and process the transactions for each of the customers ensuring that there are no fraudulent transactions. How do they do this? How do they manage all the data of their customers. 

In this project, we aim to develop a credit card management system which emulates that of companies like Amex, Discover, etc.
