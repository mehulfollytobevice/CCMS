# Credit Card Data Management System
Companies like Amex have millions of customers with multiple credit cards. They have to manage and process the transactions for each of the customers ensuring that there are no fraudulent transactions. How do they do this? How do they manage all the data of their customers. 

In this project, we aim to develop a credit card data management system which is similar to that of companies like Amex, Discover, etc.
